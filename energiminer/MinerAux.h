    /*
       doMiner function starts Plant and in farm it starts miners intended to mine e.g. CPUMiner And/or Gpuminer
       doMiner runs a loop where,
           1. it calls getblocktemplate to get the new work
           2. Prepares a Work object, which essentially contains data to be mined after parsing getblocktemplate.
           3. Since there is no queue concept here because of no need of mining old set of transactions to create new block
              Simply reset the Work everytime we get new data
              So doMiner sets work on Plant which internally is meant to forward to all Miners.
           4. One way is to let Plant make a call back as soon as data is ready by using proper synchronization techniques e.g. events
           5. Other is to make a good guess of a few milliseconds wait to check for next getblocktemplate if is different

           What goes inside plant
           6. Inside Plant
              a. Plant runs the miners which is also called as a worker, and a worker spawns a thread to do its job and listen for new work
              b. As soon as plant gets new Work, it sets the data for all miners and expects miners to restart ASAP on new data.
           Basically by requesting them to finish ASAP old block being mined as there is no point.
           Miners drop existing work and take new Work and start mining fresh.
           As soon as a miner finds a solution, it calls plant onSolutionFind and plant expects it to be picked up on next check in doMiner.

           7. Threading design
           8. doMiner runs in main thread
              - Plant starts miners (miner is a worker)
              - miner instead spawns a child thread to do the real mine work and also keep ears open to listen for new data.
              - we need to synchronize plant and miner communication
